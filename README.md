# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview of Project:
##  To help AutosRUs' manufacturing team with the newest prototype, MechaCar, the following statistical analysis has been performed on data collected by the production team:
- Multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of the MechaCar prototypes;
- Collection of summary statistics on the pounds per inch of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots;
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population;
- Design a statistical study to compare performance of the MechaCar against vehicles from other manufacturers.
